I wanted to welcome everybody who has joined the user testing board on Trello and thank you for volunteering to serve asÂ a beta tester for EduGuide. Initially, the exercises I posted were very feature-based, but as more members have joined the Trello board I'm thinking it might be easier if everybody was able to simply join the site and get a taste for what it is all about. So, as a first exercise I'm asking everybody to join a team I've set up on our live site. Once you're a member, you are welcome to try out the features and ask questions about the site.
