<span style="font-weight: 400;">Last night, we rolled out a new feature in our paths system which will allow students to very quickly look up definitions and translations for words in activities which seem unclear to them. Starting this week, if a student would like to look up a definition for a word they can do so by highlighting the word with their mouse. An overlay containing a definition for the word will appear. The student can also translate the word into different languages. The terms that students look up in the path will be stored in their personal glossary, which is accessible from the pathâ€™s menu.</span>
