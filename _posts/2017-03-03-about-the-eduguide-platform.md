EduGuide is a non profit based in Lansing which is working to be build an online platform which gives every student an opportunity to achieve their life long goals. The feature on our site which students most commonly use is called the Path. This is a delivery system for a set of curriculum which teaches students the importance of strong character, perseverance, and how to support others through mentoring.

Teachers and school administrators manage the students from inside a team. Within the team, they are organized into three types of coaches: Admin coaches, lead coaches, and support coaches. Each coaching role has a unique set of capabilities and responsibilities. Each team can also have a team captain, who helps the rest of the coaches as they work with students on their paths.

Team coaches have access to a team dashboard, from which they can communicate with each other, a metrics page where they can monitor students' progress in the path, a tool which allows them to organize students into group, plus more.

Follow the <em>EduGuide Insider</em> to learn more about EduGuide and it's platform. I'll also be sharing previews of upcoming new features, and user testing opportunities.
