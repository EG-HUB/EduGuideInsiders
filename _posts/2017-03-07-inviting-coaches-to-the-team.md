<h1>Inviting Coaches to the team</h1>
<p></p>
<p>After a team is launched, admin coaches are able to invite additional coaches to the team from the Coaches page.</p>
<p>You can navigate to the Coaches page by clicking on the gear icon located next to the Library in the blue navigational toolbar below the title of the team, then “Coaches.” Inside the Manage Team Coaches page you will see a list of coaches who have accepted their invitations, and any coaches who are still pending. Enter the email address for the person who you would like to invite, then select their coach role.’ To find out more information about these roles click the “?” image. Click on the role title for further information about the goals and responsibilities of each role. Next, click “Send Invite.” A window will appear prompting you for an optional custom message before your invitation is sent. If you need to edit or make changes to an email invitation, click on “Manage” above the Team Coaches’ names and emails (see ‘Removing Coaches’ below for more information).</p>
<p>The team invitation will contain a brief message and a button to connect recipients to the site where they can begin the EduGuide account creation process. They will be prompted for their registration information,then taken into their path.</p>

After you’ve changed modes, an “x” will appear next to each coach’s name in the list. Click the “x” next to any coach who you would like to remove. Click “done” when you are finished.</p>
