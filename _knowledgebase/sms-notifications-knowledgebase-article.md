<h1>Notifications via Text Messaging</h1>
EduGuide recently rolled out a new feature which will allow team members to receive reminders and comment notifications via text message. The following document will describe how the text messages will work, and the steps members should follow when they are enabling them for their account.
<h1>Types of text notifications</h1>
Text notifications will be sent to a member with SMS notifications enabled whenever the following events occur:
<ul>
 	<li>Post on user’s dashboard</li>
 	<li>Post on Team dashboard</li>
 	<li>Comment in a user’s path</li>
 	<li>Path activity Reminder</li>
</ul>
The text messages will be brief, and will sometimes contain an attached link which users can follow back to the site. They will be taken directly to the location where they can take an action or respond to a comment. If they are not logged in, they will be prompted for their username and password.

Path activity reminders will go out to users each Sunday who have not stayed active in their path.
<h2>Comment notifications</h2>
SMS notifications follow the same rules as email notifications. For example, as someone posts or responds to comments on your dashboard, those messages will be delayed and queued up before they are sent out as a single text message.
<h1>Enabling SMS Notifications</h1>
There are two ways in which members will be able to enabled the SMS notification feature. They can turn on this feature in their Settings page. Members will also be prompted for their phone number and asked to enable the feature as they complete activities in the path.
<h2>Responding to the prompt inside the Path</h2>
As members are completing activities in their path, the following message will appear:

In order to enable SMS notifications, you will need to click on the checkbox next to “Enable mobile notifications” and enter your cell phone number under the field labeled Phone. Once you’ve made these changes, click “Save.”
<h2>Editing SMS Notifications inside your Personal Settings Page</h2>
From inside the path, open up the menu on the left hand side of the screen, then click “Personal Dashboard.” Next, click on the menu next to the EduGuide logo and then click “My Settings.”

Your settings for mobile notifications will be shown towards the very bottom under the header “Mobile.” Enter your cell phone number into the field labeled “Phone” and click on the checkbox next to “Enable mobile notifications” to turn on the feature.

If you need to, you can always return to your personal mobile notifications settings here on your My Settings page and turn off the feature by unchecking the checkbox.

<h2>Stopping SMS notifications via text</h2>
You can also disable SMS notifications from your mobile phone by sending the command “stop.” You will then receive a confirmation message stating that you have been unsubscribed from EduGuide notifications. Sending the command “subscribe” will resume the text messages. You can also send the command “Help” for an explanation on how to use the commands.
