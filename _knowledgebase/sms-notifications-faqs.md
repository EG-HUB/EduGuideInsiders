<h1>SMS Notifications FAQs</h1>

A: We will only use your number to send reminders, comment notifications, and updates.
<h2>Q: Is this available to all students on my team?</h2>
A: Yes
<h2>Q: Can coaches receive SMS notifications or only students?</h2>
A: Both coaches and students can enable SMS notifications from their personal settings page. Only students will be prompted in their path.
<h2>Q: How do I opt into SMS notifications?</h2>
A: A prompt will appear to students as they are working in their paths. It will ask them for their cell phone number and prompt them to enable the SMS notification feature. Coaches and students can also enable this feature from their My Settings page.

<h2>Q: Can I respond to a post notification via text message?</h2>

<h2>Q: Can I respond to students via text message?</h2>
A: Comment notifications will contain a link which will take you to the Metrics page where you can view the student’s path progress and respond to their comment.
